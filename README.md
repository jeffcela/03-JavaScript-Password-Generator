# 03-JavaScript-Password-Generator

This project was to create a random password generator that included numbers, lowercase/uppercase letters, and special characters using javascript. The user is prompted by several alerts that allows them to choose what characters are used in the random password. To increase the experience a copy to clipboard button was included so that the user has a quick way to get the password from the generator to their desired input field for use.
